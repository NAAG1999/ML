Embedded Systems: To perform a specific task we design a hardware, which is known as Embedded systems.

Machine learning : To train a system whose inputs are the outputs generated from arduino( ES)

IOT : 
--> Internet 
--> Networks : No. of nodes are connected to serve sharing of data
-->		Things capable of communication
		
--> IOT:
		is diff from automation
		It is not controlling machine remotely
		When our system is capable of transmitting information remotely it is IOT (using sensors)

				EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

Arduino is micro controller ( only on micro controller we can do programming ) ( we need to have a memory (micro processor) to do programming)

Registers are used for storing at local computer. 

cache :: cpu

virtual memory :: os

Arduino OS --> For simplicity we use Linux OS, and that for multiple processes.

Micro instruction : Load A
Micro operation : 	Read data from memory
			Move it on bus	
			Make register A active
			Transfer at time cycle T1

An embedded system is an applied computer system as distinguished from other types of comp sys.

Applications:

Automative
Consumer Elec
Industrial control
Medical Equipment
Office Automation
